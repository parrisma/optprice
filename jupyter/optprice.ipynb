    "## Starting Point\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks are excellent function approximators, so in a data rich world such as finance it would seem possible to train neural networks to learn these option pricing function. The question is **why** would we do this, when we have perfectly good and well established computer models that can already do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "* **Option** a financial contract with a value contingent on some initial terms and how the financial markets move during the life of the contract.\n",
    "* **Model** a mathematical algorithm that can determine the value of a specific type of option.\n",
    "* **Neural Network** or **NN** A function approximator based on matrix manipulation that can be trained to find an approximate general form of a function given sufficient examples of input parameters and corresponding result(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many simple options that can be modelled *closed form*, i.e. with an equation, where we pass the valuation details and with relatively little compute cost and delay we are given a reliable valuation. \n",
    "\n",
    "However there are more complex options that have no such *closed form* as they have complex features. Typically these are *path dependent*, as in it matters how their valuation parameter change over time, and to solve these a very common solution is to run many simulations of how the valuation parameters will evolve in the future. We then valuation the option on all of these simulated future paths. It is then possible to combine the results of the simulations and establish the optimal price of the option. Where the *optimal* price is the price that would compensate the seller for entering into a contract where there is a likelihood they will have to pay out to tye buyer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these path dependent case, the number of simulations needed to get an accurate price can be very high. As such the compute costs is high and the time to run the calculation is also long, relative to the *closed form* cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically when selling (offering) options, the seller will make a market, by pricing many different terms and will also respond to **r**equest **f**or **q**uotes (RFQs) during the trading day. This can amount to a very significant number of calculations and as such significant compute costs eating into margins. In addition the time it can take to quite may be seen as client differentiating if it can be done more quickly than other sellers. In addition once a trade is done, the seller must re-value the trade as the market moves so they can understand their profit and loss as well as [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) their risks. Again, this can involve a significant number of costly calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis  \n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is slow to train but quick when making a prediction, as it is in essence a simple matrix multiplication. So the hypothesis we look at here is:\n",
    "> Can a neural network be trained to estimate the financial option contract pay-offs and be accurate enough to have commercial use.\n",
    "* If they can be trained is it more cost effective to train a neural network than to run it on demand as needed\n",
    "* and is the neural network quicker when predicting than the equivalent direct model call.\n",
    "* Then finally, are there viable commercial uses, proprietary trading, client valuations and approved in regulatory settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normal Day to Day operations generate many option valuations, which if captured this data could be used as training data\n",
    "* Such, Day to Day data may not cover all possible scenarios, so might need to be augmented by creating specific training data\n",
    "* Some complex financial options have many features, and feature spaces of 50 to 100 would require a significant amount of training data to ensure coverage in high such dimensions.\n",
    "* Neural networks will always make a prediction, even when untrained.\n",
    "* From a client and regulatory point of view [expandability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) is a challenge as the seller may not be able to show why a certain price was given.\n",
    "* As the markets move, the neural will need re-training, however this can be done by re-training the existing neural network with additional data, but it needs to be monitored.\n",
    "* Accuracy will not be consistent, it will depend on where the prediction falls in feature space and how well covered that region is.\n",
    "* Availability of data, the sellers organization will need to be set-up to value data and its monetization. Otherwise the cost of souring the data and changing the organization mindset will be prohibitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a Neural Net to predict a:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple closed form model. This is not a target use case but is a first step in the proof.\n",
    "2. Simple closed form model, with a simulated barrier condition to see how the NN behaves with step changes in price\n",
    "3. Path dependent option with a small feature space.\n",
    "4. Extrapolate the results to consider\n",
    "   1. Data demands to train the neural network\n",
    "   2. Relative cost of compute, on-demand vs trained neural network\n",
    "   3. Relative speed of pricing \n",

    "   7. Seller concerns\n",
    "   8. Regulatory concerns\n",

    "\n",
    "Our [closed form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression) model is the [Black Scholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) option model. This will allow us to show the work flow and highlight the challenges with the approach.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model also takes an function that inspects the price, volatility and Time to maturity and *optionally* modifies the price if it hit a condition in terms of price, volatility and time. This is to allow us to model the case where the option price has abrupt changes rather than smooth ones. Abrupt changes will be more of a challenge for the model to capture. We do this as many commercially traded options do have such [barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_option) features (knock-in, knock-out, up-and-out etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This naive implementation will run on the CPU only. There are techniques to utilize all CPU cores, however these vary by language C++, Python etc and are non trivial to get right and distract from the problem at hand. As we will see later using tensorflow, it is possible to create language independent computation graphs that can fully utilize the GPU(s) available. This is s significant step up as a contemporary GPU will have approx. 10'000 cores compared to a CPU with approx 16 cores."

    "In the real use case we will collect the back history  [RFQ (request for quote)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/request-for-quote.asp) as training data for the neural network. This presents the first challenge as to train the model we need a spread of data across all combinations of all parameters and instrument details that impact the price we are trying to predict. If we have gaps in our training data there will also be a weakness in the model when predicting prices with that specific combination of inputs.\n",
    "\n",

So we will need to review the spread of inputs we have and make sure (expert judgment) that there are sufficient examples for all of the combinations we are likely to quote. If the markets shift significantly we can also add additional training data, but we must be aware when the model is being asked to make predictions outside of its experience.\n",

    "> There’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum\n",
    "\n",
    "Our *spherical chicken in a vacuum* is the Nobel winning [Black Scholes Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model), while ground breaking, out of the box it represents a best case, where our option is a spherical chicken in a vacuum, with a well behaved pay off. In practice there are many embellishments required to accommodate dividends, early exercise, barriers, cross currency (quanto) etc. These embellishments make the pay off less well behaved in mathematical terms. This is relevant to us, as approximating functions with complex, sharp or instantaneous transitions with a large number of parameters is harder then approximating functions with a small number of parameters and smooth transitions. The real world use case where an options have a barrier conditions, where within a given range of pricing inputs the option behavior changes, sometimes instantaneously to zero value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can gain an intuition for this complexity by looking at Fourier transforms, which is another way of approximating functions. There is a way of modelling a sharp transition (step function) using Fourier transforms. However to effectively model this instantaneous transition we must allow ourselves to use functions of infinitely high frequency. Clearly this is not practical, so limit ourselves to finite frequencies that yield a workable level of accuracy. There is a similar trade off with neural networks, we cannot have infinitely complex networks, we must try to find the least complexity that can capture and generalise the payoff with a tradable level of accuracy and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cells below, we show how fourier transforms work and compare five frequency terms versus one hundred frequency terms. Where more terms give us a very close approximation, but still an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analogy with neural networks is that as the real world complexity rises, we require a significant amount of data and deep networks to capture the payoff.\n",

    "Now we have completed a basic proof of concept with simple closed form, we move on to look at path dependant options with a much higher cost of compute and an even more complex payoff function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get going we have taken a path dependant option from an open source git repo, that is implemented as a tensor flow model that can run on a GPU. We need this as calculating millions of path dependant option values for training takes days or elapse time, even with a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of option allows for an early exercise, where the buyer can exit the contract before the defined maturity date. As such this is another type of feature for the neural network to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we follow the same pattern, by creating a set of all possible features, which comes to more than 12 million points even on a fairly corse grid. The value of the option for each scenario is then calculated. This gives us a training data set, but this time it is expensive to calculate and as the payoff is more complex we need more data. This highlights the trend that will be a challenge for this approach, the more complex the option, the more data we need which is now more expensive to compute. Which is why we try to use past quotes (calculations) as we have these for free. However they may not evenly cover the feature space we need to train for"
